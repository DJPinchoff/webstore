## Project Description
This project was created to practice a specific modal HTML/CSS coding technique. I worked on creating functionality in which a hidden checkbox toggles the appearance of its linked image to the foreground. At the same time, a dark transparent background "dims" the rest of the web store gallery. Then, clicking anywhere allows the larger image to disappear while normal function continues.
